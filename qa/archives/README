Good QA archives that are static.

Some of these archives are truncated, but they are otherwise believed
to be either correct or contain the sort of benign errors that the
PCP code base is expected to handle gracefully.

These ones are checked into the git tree.

The goal here is that pmlogcheck -w should report no issues for all
the archives in this directory.  The ./check-archives script may be
used to check this.

For some of them, the makefile and the associated pmlogger
configuration files and scripts provide recipes for recreating them.

Others come from sources that are not reproducible, e.g. users
reporting bugs.

See also ../badarchives for bad QA archives and ../tmparch for the
dynamically recreated QA archives.

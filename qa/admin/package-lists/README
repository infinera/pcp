There is one file in this directory for each known distro:version:arch
combination e.g. Ubuntu:20.04:x86_64, and the contents of the file nominate
the non-PCP packages that need to be installed for a successful PCP build
and QA (at least as far as CI is concerned).

If the list is the same for all architectures for a given distro:version
combination, then "any" may be used in lieu of a specific architecture.

The format of each file is as follows:

- anything following a hash (#) is assumed to be a comment
- fields are separated by white space 
- one line per package starting with the primary package-name as the
  first field, optionally followed by "|" and an alternate package-name
  (may be more than one of these), optionally followed by one or more "tags"
  (arbitrary words)
- whitespace around a "|" is optional
- whitespace before any "tag" is required

Some examples:

    autoconf
    # mumble
    Some_Random::Package cpan	# don't need to install this
    minimal-curl | curl not4ci
    larry|curly|moe		# any of the 3 stooges will do

Some standard "tags" and their meaning:

cpan	package needs to be installed with cpan(1)
pip3	package needs to be installed with pip3(1)
not4ci	do not install this package in CI (usually a container or
	VM conflict)

When using "list-packages -m" (like in CI or for a new VM), the only packages
listed will be the primary packages, and these will only be listed if NONE
of the primary and alternate packages are already installed.

The ./new script may be used to generate/regenerate a file for the
distro:version:architecture combination on which ./new is run.  This uses
the check-vm infrastructure and is intended to provide a way to "seed"
the file, then any subsequent fine tuning is done by editing the file in
this directory.

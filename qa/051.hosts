# Each $remote_x must be assigned to a valid hostname that can be
# looked up using the local DNS ... they do _not_ have to have PCP
# installed nor pmcd(1) running ... but they _do_ need to map to five
# unique IP addresses ... and we'd prefer the mapping to be stable, so
# this rules out Akamai and AWS (for example)
#
# Used in setup.051 and 051.

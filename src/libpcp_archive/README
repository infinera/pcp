libpcp_arch

This library contains "helper" routines for apps that need to write
PCP archives.

There are some spartan man pages, see <pcp/archive.h> for prototypes.

This library is NOT thread-safe, because at this stage all of the
intended client apps are single threaded, e.g. pmlogextract,
pmlogrewrite, pmlogreduce.

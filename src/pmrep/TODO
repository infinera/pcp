- comment, clean up, optimize code
- update sar/iostat/pidstat metricsets to match latest sysstat
- drop obsolete metricsets from config files
- drop deprecated pmconfig.py methods

- verify metric labels printing (-m)
  - test instance vs metric labels
- enhanced metric labels support [-M]
  - report metrics based on matched labels (pmrep -M foo:env=prod)
- prom2json like output
  - https://github.com/prometheus/prom2json
- consider metric labels support in pmrep.conf

- change default precision to 2 (?)
- generalized zabbix_interval (write to target in batches) (?)

- check and/or clean "# Instance(s)" checks in pmconfig.py (??)
- there was some issue with derived metrics, probably best not to
  check indom but PM_IN_NULL to make sure everything needed for derived
  is being fetched (???) - see https://groups.io/g/pcp/message/21806

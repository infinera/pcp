.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmerr

.PP
Each
.I code
may be an integer, a hexadecimal value or a hexadecimal value prefixed
by either ``0x'' or ``0X''.
.PP
Error codes must be less than zero, so if
.I code

negated value is used.
.SH OPTIONS
The available command line options are:
.TP 5
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR

listed, along with their symbolic names and error text.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage message and exit.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT

the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
